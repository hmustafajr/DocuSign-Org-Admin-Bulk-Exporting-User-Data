# DocuSign-Org-Admin-Bulk-Exporting-User-Data
The bulk export and bulk import operations create or update large numbers of user accounts records within an organization. I can also be used to verify your account users and their permissions. 

This code example will return a URL that you will have to call to download a .csv file which contains the user data for all users within your organization.

You can edit this file as desired, then perform a bulk import update or close (close will close the user accounts).
