# DocuSign-Org-Admin-Bulk-Exporting-User-Data
Bulk export and bulk import operations to create or update large numbers of user accounts within an organization, or to verify your account users and their permissions. 


This code example returns a URL that you can call to download a CSV (comma separated value) file that contains the user data for all of the users within your organization. You can edit this file as desired, then perform a bulk import update or close.
